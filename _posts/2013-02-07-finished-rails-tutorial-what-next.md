A few weeks ago I finished the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartle. It was a great intro into the Rails framework and Ruby itself for me. There was a lot to learn packed into this tutorial. Not just Ruby and Rails, but Behavior Driven Development, using GIT for source control and pushing to Github, and publishing on Heroku. Now that I've finished it though, where to go next?

I know the best way to learn a language is to use it, so I've started a project in Rails that should be a lot of fun. However, since it is my first app I know it won't be very polished. Since I have plans to move it into production one day I am looking for other ways to refine my knowledge of Ruby and Rails and Web Development in general before I refactor my first app's code.

One way to do this is going further in depth with the Ruby language. I love the modular nature of Ruby where everything is an object. I am currently reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/ref=pd_sim_b_3">the pickaxe</a> book by Dave Thomas and trying to pick up some knowledge there. Also, I picked up a book on BDD so I can learn more about following the Red/Green/Refactor path of development. I feel this can really help me write better code and be more efficient. As I move through these books I'm going to try and find some other small projects to sharpen my skills before moving back to my original project.
